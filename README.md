# Text-to-Speech
This is a simple web application that converts text to speech using the Web Speech API in JavaScript.

## Usage
To use the application, simply enter the text you want to convert to speech in the input box and click the "Speak" button. The application will then use the Web Speech API to read the text out loud.

You can also adjust the voice, pitch, and rate of the speech using the options on the page.

## Requirements
This application requires a modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
